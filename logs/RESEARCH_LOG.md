# Research step log

## 2026-10-25 — Prediction page implementation
- **Phase:** Prediction interface / integration
- **Status:** Implementation scaffold committed to phase branch; live prediction remains blocked pending verified model and data artifacts.
- **Completed:** Added responsive GitHub Pages frontend, date-selectable published prediction history, JSON schema, inference script, workflow with manual dispatch and scheduled run, and documented acceptance gates.
- **Validation:** Repository was inspected before changes. Existing main branch contained README.md and scripts/fetch_dhan_recent.py only; no trained model, processed feature table, expiry calendar, or workflow was present in the inspected tree.
- **Critical limitation:** A real ExtraTrees forecast cannot be truthfully produced until compatible model/features/expiry-calendar files exist. The interface explicitly reports unavailable rather than fabricate results.
- **Next gate:** Supply/produce compatible model and data artifacts through the research pipeline; run inference and tests; verify GitHub Pages settings and workflow success.


## 2026-10-25 — Restore research-backed ExtraTrees prediction page
- **Phase:** Prediction interface / model integration
- **Status:** Integration staged on `phase-prediction-live-integration`; ready for workflow validation after merge.
- **Finding:** Existing research branch already had the proper `research_core.py` pipeline, leakage-aware `build_pages_forecasts.py`, an 80-record chronological holdout, and a latest forward forecast. The prior main-branch stub did not connect to that pipeline.
- **Correction:** Replaced the placeholder UI with the research-backed date-selectable page and copied the forecast payload, inference/export code, dependencies, processed data, official close/expiry reference files, tests, and research workflow into this integration branch.
- **Latest saved forecast:** As-of 2026-10-21 10:00 IST; target expiry 2026-10-27; direction DOWN; model p_up 0.384781. This is a previously generated record, not a new calculation on 2026-10-25.
- **Acceptance status:** UI/data contract is implemented; full automated run and GitHub Pages deployment still need to pass. Data-quality gate remains BLOCKED; anchor prices are not independently validated. No executable trading strategy is certified.
- **Next:** Merge integration PR, inspect the Actions runs, correct failures, and verify the published Pages URL.
