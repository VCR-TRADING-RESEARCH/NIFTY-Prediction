# Visible conversation decisions

## 2026-10-25
- User clarified the required deliverable: a page that predicts the upcoming NIFTY expiry using the ExtraTrees Classifier and a selectable as-of date.
- Assistant acknowledged that a prediction CSV/backtesting configuration was not the requested deliverable.
- User approved proceeding.
- Implementation decision: provide a GitHub Pages reporting UI backed by published prediction records; use strict unavailable state when model/data prerequisites are missing. Do not record hidden reasoning or internal chain-of-thought.


## 2026-10-25 — Continued integration after user approval
- User again approved proceeding to finish the as-of-date ExtraTrees expiry prediction page.
- Repository inspection found an existing research-backed forecast payload and exporter on the research/phase-6-prediction-pages branch. The latest saved forecast was as-of 2026-10-21 10:00 IST for candidate expiry 2026-10-27, direction DOWN, p_up approximately 0.3848; source gate blocked.
- Corrective decision: integrate the existing walk-forward exporter, page JavaScript/CSS, JSON payload, research pipeline, data artifacts, tests and workflows rather than maintain a duplicate stub.
- Visible conversation decisions only; hidden chain-of-thought is not stored.
