## 2026-10-25
- User clarified the required deliverable: a page that predicts the upcoming NIFTY expiry using the ExtraTrees Classifier and a selectable as-of date.
- Assistant acknowledged that a prediction CSV/backtesting configuration was not the requested deliverable.
- User approved proceeding.
- Implementation decision: provide a GitHub Pages reporting UI backed by published prediction records; use strict unavailable state when model/data prerequisites are missing. Do not record hidden reasoning or internal chain-of-thought.
