# Visible conversation decisions

## 2026-10-25
- User clarified the required deliverable: a page that predicts the upcoming NIFTY expiry using the ExtraTrees Classifier and a selectable as-of date.
- Assistant acknowledged that a prediction CSV/backtesting configuration was not the requested deliverable.
- User approved proceeding.
- Implementation decision: provide a GitHub Pages reporting UI backed by published prediction records; use strict unavailable state when model/data prerequisites are missing. Do not record hidden reasoning or internal chain-of-thought.


## 2026-10-25 — Continued integration after user approval
- User again approved proceeding to finish the as-of-date ExtraTrees expiry prediction page.
- Repository inspection found an existing research-backed forecast payload and exporter on the research/phase-6-prediction-pages branch. The latest saved forecast was as-of 2026-10-21 10:00 IST for candidate expiry 2026-10-27, direction DOWN, p_up approximately 0.3848; source gate blocked.
- Corrective decision: integrate the existing walk-forward exporter, page JavaScript/CSS, JSON payload, research pipeline, data artifacts, tests and workflows rather than maintain a duplicate stub.
- Visible conversation decisions only; hidden chain-of-thought is not stored.

## 2026-10-25 — Live inference requirement clarified
- User clarified the desired behavior: on clicking Predict, refresh the Dhan token, fetch the NIFTY data required through the chosen as-of date from Dhan API, run the ExtraTrees classifier, and show that newly computed prediction.
- Decision recorded: keep credentials on a server-side inference service; GitHub Pages must not contain Dhan/GitHub/Hugging Face secrets. Static CSV/JSON lookup was not acceptable as the Predict action.
- Implementation branch: `phase/live-dhan-inference`. See [Phase 7 plan](../docs/PHASE_7_LIVE_DHAN_INFERENCE.md).
- Only visible conversation decisions and engineering rationales are logged; hidden private chain-of-thought is not stored.

## 2026-10-25 — Live service provider blocker discovered
- Deployment workflow reached Hugging Face Space creation, then received HTTP 402. Current Hugging Face docs state Docker/Gradio CPU-basic Spaces require an individual Pro subscription or Team/Enterprise for organizations. Static GitHub Pages cannot securely hold the Dhan PIN/TOTP secret or execute Python, so direct browser-only fallback is not safe.
- A follow-up deployment-script diagnostic bug (temporary directory variable shadowing the stage label) was corrected and logged as E0009; the next run reconfirmed HTTP 402 at the Space-creation stage.
- User intervention is now required to provide eligible Hugging Face compute or point `HF_SPACE_ID` at an existing writable, eligible Docker Space. No secrets are copied into the page or repository logs.


## 2026-10-25 — Alternative backend approved
- User approved proceeding with a secure alternative backend while keeping GitHub Pages as the front end.
- Decision: do not place Dhan PIN/TOTP in the browser or use a publicly callable GitHub Actions trigger. Current Hugging Face provisioning is blocked by HTTP 402; no other host deployment credential is available in the repository workflow configuration.
- Next actionable prerequisite: eligible existing Docker Space ID or a credential for a host such as Render/Cloudflare. Then deploy, test live Dhan auth/history, and verify browser result rendering.


## 2026-10-25 — GitHub Actions execution approved
- User approved proceeding with a design where the Pages Predict action runs Python in GitHub Actions.
- Implemented a prefilled, authenticated GitHub issue request as the secure trigger; GitHub Actions executes the existing Dhan-backed ExtraTrees pipeline, and Pages polls for a newly generated date-specific JSON result. The workflow has owner/member authorization checks and a manual dispatch input.
- Explicit limitation: because static Pages has no private credentials, the user must submit the prefilled request in GitHub after clicking the request link. No browser token or Dhan secret is exposed.
- The workflow and frontend are not yet live-verified. Keep status transparent until CI, permissions, Pages publication and Dhan inference succeed.


## 2026-10-25 — GitHub Actions workflow validation and smoke test
- PR #8 implemented the Actions inference path and merged after CI passed; PR #10 broadened the authorized issue-trigger gate and added retry support, also after CI passed.
- A controlled request issue #9 was opened and reopened to test the real event path. At the latest inspection, no completion comment or result JSON was visible, so the live Dhan workflow is not yet verified end-to-end.
- Visible decisions and test status are logged; no hidden chain-of-thought is recorded.


## 2026-10-25 — Diagnosed first actual Dhan request
- The first non-skipped workflow reached inference but wrote a failure record: HTTP 405 during Dhan token generation. Official docs show the endpoint requires POST, while the code used GET.
- Corrected method, added a mocked regression test, and changed runner exit status so failures fail the inference step. Triggered a retry by editing request issue #11. Run [40201653154](https://github.com/VCR-TRADING-RESEARCH/NIFTY-Prediction/actions/runs/40201653154) was in progress at latest check.
- A separate Actions cache write-scope warning was observed and is not considered solved. No successful forecast claimed yet.


## 2026-10-25 — First fresh live prediction completed
- Fixed the Dhan token-refresh HTTP method (GET to POST) based on official DhanHQ docs, added a mocked regression test, and made inference failures return a non-zero process exit.
- Retry run [40201653154](https://github.com/VCR-TRADING-RESEARCH/NIFTY-Prediction/actions/runs/40201653154) succeeded and wrote the live result for 2024-09-20: UP, raw UP score 51.3%, target expiry 2024-09-26, 147 training labels, 268,510 minute bars, training through 2024-09-19.
- This confirms the Dhan-backed Python/Actions/Pages publication path can produce a fresh result. The source-quality gate remains BLOCKED because the 10:00 anchor is not independently reconciled and costs/options P&L are not validated. It is historical, not a current signal.
- The Pages UI opens a prefilled GitHub issue link and requires submitting it; this remains a usability limitation. The result should appear in the original Pages tab that is polling, after the workflow publishes.


## 2026-10-25 — Result deep link added
- Added `?as_of_date=YYYY-MM-DD` support to the Pages predictor so a completed date-specific JSON result can be opened directly without generating another request. The Actions completion comment now links back to that exact result page.
- Pages deployment for the deep-link JavaScript passed in run [40201836007](https://github.com/VCR-TRADING-RESEARCH/NIFTY-Prediction/actions/runs/40201836007). A later documentation deployment was still running at latest inspection.
- Direct historical result link: https://vcr-trading-research.github.io/NIFTY-Prediction/?as_of_date=2024-09-20. External browser verification of the rendered page was unavailable; the JSON record and deployment run are verified.


## 2026-10-26 — User authorised Phase 10 continuation
- User message: “Proceed”.
- Decision: run one bounded rebuild using authenticated Dhan intraday anchors plus official NSE daily OHLC and verified expiry dates, then perform one locked chronological walk-forward evaluation of fixed baseline and augmented candidates.
- Target and feature clock remain unchanged. The official daily session calendar is used even where Dhan bars are absent, so provider coverage gaps cannot shift the target anchor.
- No private chain-of-thought is recorded; this log captures the visible decision and auditable method.


## 2026-10-26 — Phase 10 bounded evaluation result and publication fixes
- Visible user direction: “Resume”.
- The authenticated-Dhan/official-NSE rebuild completed with 256 source-gated weekly cycles. The chronological split was 204 development rows and 52 holdout rows; the 104-cycle warm-up left 100 scored development predictions.
- Base ExtraTrees balanced accuracy on the holdout was 54.85%; the six-feature augmented ExtraTrees result was 53.79%. Difference −1.06 percentage points; paired four-week moving-block bootstrap 95% interval −5.00 to +3.44 points. The preregistered screen failed; no new directional method is validated.
- Trading acceptance remains blocked pending contract-level futures/options fills and date-effective Paytm Money fees, spread and slippage validation.
- Operational publication failures in runs 40282004301 and 40283034584 were traced to a heredoc boundary and escaped workflow expressions, respectively. A standalone reporter and corrected workflow expressions were committed. These are workflow errors, not evidence about model performance.


## 2026-10-26 — User approved broader model-family research
- User challenged why the prior result discussed only ExtraTrees.
- Decision: treat ExtraTrees as a baseline, not the research endpoint. Register Phase 11 to compare a bounded set of distinct statistical/ML families with shared chronological prediction dates and fold-local preprocessing.
- The Phase 10 holdout has already been examined; Phase 11 results must be labelled exploratory and cannot be called a fresh confirmatory test.
- User approved continuation with “Ok proceed”. Only visible decisions and engineering rationale are recorded; hidden chain-of-thought is not stored.


## 2026-10-26 — User said “Proceed” for Phase 11
- The Phase 11 workflow completed successfully in run 40284704966. On 152 chronological expanding-window forecasts, ExtraTrees had balanced accuracy 57.8%, followed by Random Forest 57.3%; all metrics are exploratory because the historical sample/holdout has already been inspected.
- Audit identified a protocol omission: no block-bootstrap uncertainty interval was included despite the plan requiring dependence-aware stability reporting. A fixed four-week paired bootstrap and test were added for the ExtraTrees-versus-majority and ExtraTrees-versus-Random-Forest comparisons. Await CI validation.
- No strategy is validated; realistic contract-level P&L and Paytm Money fees/spread/slippage remain a separate required gate. Only visible decisions and rationale are recorded, not hidden chain-of-thought.
