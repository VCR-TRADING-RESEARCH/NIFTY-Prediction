# Error, Omission and Correction Log

Do not delete earlier entries. Add dated entries with severity, symptom, root cause, fix, test and residual risk.

## E0001 — 2026-10-25 — Repository had no initial files
- Severity: Medium / bootstrapping blocker.
- Symptom: GitHub contents API returned 404 with message “This repository is empty” for README and expected plan/log paths.
- Root cause: No initial commit or branch contents existed.
- Fix: Created initial README commit and seeded dedicated research/phase-0-foundation branch.
- Validation: GitHub commit API returned a commit SHA; repository metadata confirmed default branch main and authenticated admin/push permissions.
- Residual risk: No previous experiments, hidden data files or logs could be resumed because the repository was empty.

## E0002 — 2026-10-25 — Local shell had no network DNS
- Severity: Low / data execution limitation for current interactive session.
- Symptom: Python urllib test from the container failed with “Temporary failure in name resolution”.
- Root cause: Current container execution environment cannot download external files directly.
- Fix: Verified source metadata through connected GitHub/web tools and designed GitHub Actions to download/cache data in the repository runtime.
- Residual risk: This assistant session has not locally executed the full historical backtest. A GitHub Actions run is required for empirical outputs.

## E0003 — 2026-10-25 — Intraday source has published data-quality caveats
- Severity: High until independently reconciled.
- Symptom: Upstream README lists missing minute bars, frozen-price stretches and partial/special sessions.
- Root cause: Third-party archival/cleaning imperfections can affect anchor and closing-price selection.
- Fix: Require OHLC invariants, duplicate/missing-session reporting, raw row timestamps, explicit expiry-calendar status and sample comparison to NSE/Dhan.
- Residual risk: Do not certify confirmatory inference until source validation passes.


## GitHub Actions failure — run 40167544027
- Status: BLOCKED. One or more workflow steps failed; inspect the Actions run for the exact failing step.
- The workflow is configured to continue with public data when the optional Dhan branch fails.
- No secrets, access tokens, PINs or TOTP values should be copied from runner diagnostics into repository logs.


## Dhan authentication attempt — run 40167611476
- Status: FAILED or incomplete. The public archive route will still be attempted.
- Sensitive response fields and secrets were withheld. Inspect the Dhan-auth step status in Actions.


## Dhan data cross-check — run 40167611476
- Status: FAILED or unavailable. The public archive will remain the core input; independent Dhan cross-check did not pass.
- Failure responses and credentials were not added to the log. Inspect only sanitized Actions step diagnostics.
