# Error and correction log

## 2026-10-25 — Prediction page prerequisite audit
- **Finding:** The repository README described planned research artifacts/workflows that were not present in the inspected main-branch tree.
- **Impact:** No verifiable trained ExtraTrees artifact, feature matrix, or expiry calendar was available to the prediction page implementation. Producing a numerical forecast would be fabricated.
- **Correction:** Page uses a visible unavailable state; inference script requires exact trained feature names, an exact as-of-date feature row, and a verified calendar. It never silently substitutes a nearby date.
- **Status:** Open until the model/data pipeline produces compatible artifacts and a successful forecast is validated.
- **Security:** No secret values or private chain-of-thought are written to repository logs.


## E0006 — 2026-10-25 — Initial prediction page workflow failed
- Severity: High / deployment blocker.
- Symptom: GitHub Actions run 40196235090 failed at `actions/setup-python@v5`; inference and deployment steps were skipped.
- Root cause: The minimal main branch lacked the requirements file expected by pip caching, and its standalone inference script expected model artifacts that were not present. The branch also duplicated an existing research-backed forecast pipeline.
- Correction: Reuse the existing ExtraTrees pipeline and published forecast schema from the research branch; add the dependencies and pipeline assets; replace the placeholder page; use the dedicated Pages deployment workflow.
- Residual risk: The integration workflow has not yet been run on main; verify after merge. The model/source gate remains blocked for research reasons, independent of page deployment.
- Security: No secrets or private reasoning recorded.


## GitHub Actions failure — run 40196725878
- Status: BLOCKED. One or more workflow steps failed; inspect the Actions run for the exact failing step.
- The workflow is configured to continue with public data when the optional Dhan branch fails.
- No secrets, access tokens, PINs or TOTP values should be copied from runner diagnostics into repository logs.


## Dhan authentication attempt — run 40196840830
- Status: FAILED or incomplete. The public archive route will still be attempted.
- Sensitive response fields and secrets were withheld. Inspect the Dhan-auth step status in Actions.
